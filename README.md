# BiterBuddies
Factorio mod to let you summon and control your very own Biters Buddies! When I started playing Factorio with my 7 year old son, he came up with the idea for this mod. We programmed it together and released it for everyone!

# Installation:
Use the built in mod portal in Factorio.

# Usage:
Press F7 to spawn a group of random biters around your current position. 
Press F8 to call for your currently summoned biters to come and help you. They will travel to your current location and attack any enemies they find there.
Press F9 to spawn some enemy biters.

This is a work in progress, and we want to add more features! 
- Make a targetting remote item to use instead of a function key to target the biters.
- Make a way to create different control groups of biters, and match it to a targetting remote.
- Add features to the remote, like wayfinding points, like the spidertron.

This is our first Factorio mod, so the code is a bit messy, with some unused portions from our testing.

# Deployment:
Zip up this whole git archive. It's OK for the whole thing to be in a subdirectory inside the zip file.

Name it like this, according to the version in the info.json file: Biter_Buddies_1.0.1.zip

The name of the mod is case sensitive.
